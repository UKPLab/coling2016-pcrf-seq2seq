# Requirements

* M2M aligner: https://github.com/letter-to-phoneme/m2m-aligner
* Marmot: http://cistern.cis.lmu.de/marmot/

## Configuration

- Please specify the path to Marmot in the following files: 
  1. `makeModel-segmenter-order_complex.sh`
  2. `decode-simple_dev.sh`

`marmotTagger=~/projects/marmot/marmot-2015-06-12.jar`

- Specify the path to the m2m aligner in `train_complex.sh`:

`path2M2M=~/projects/OCR/OCR/m2m-aligner-master/`


# Training a model

- To train a 3rd order model for 10 iterations with quadratic penalty of 0.5 and a context window size of 4, run:

```
order=3
iter=10
qpenalty=0.5
w=4
```

`./train_complex.sh data/twitter.200.train ${order} ${iter} ${qpenalty} ${w}`

- Be sure that characters in the training file are separated by a space, and input and output strings are separated by TAB.
- Your files should be UTF-8 encoded.


# Testing a model

- After training, you can apply the trained models as follows:

`./test_dev.sh data/twitter.1K.test MODELS_cl/twitter.200.train.nopipe.m-mAlign.1-2.delX.1-best.conYX.align.rl-align.marmot-3-10-0.5-4 ${w} > my.out`

- This should lead to a word accuracy of 16.66%.

them with well-known established methods. The latter represent different
classes of traditional approaches that are applied to the monotone
sequence-to-sequence tasks OCR post-correction, spelling correction,
grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, and lemmatization.
Such tasks are of practical relevance for various higher-level research
fields including \textit{digital humanities}, automatic text correction,
and speech recognition. 
We investigate how well generic deep-learning approaches adapt to these
tasks, and how they perform in comparison with established and more
specialized methods, including our own adaptation of pruned CRFs. },
